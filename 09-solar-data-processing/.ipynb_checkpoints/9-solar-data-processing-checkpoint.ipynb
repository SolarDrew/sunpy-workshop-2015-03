      "It is not uncommon to need to rotate an image. You may want to look at a feature in a particular way, or you may need to account for the rotation of the instrument. Either way, this can be achieved with the `Map.rotate()` method, which does exactly what you would expect it to do. It can be passed a number of degrees or a rotation matrix (or neither - we'll get to that in a minute) and it will return a new Map which is a copy of the old one but rotated by the appropriate amount (anti-clockwise if degrees are specified)."
