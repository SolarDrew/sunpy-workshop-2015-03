It can be passed a number of degrees or a rotation matrix (or neither - we'll get to that in a minute) and it will return a new Map which is a copy of the old one but rotated by the appropriate amount (anti-clockwise if degrees are specified). Again, all the relevant header data is updated when you `rotate()` a Map.\n",
